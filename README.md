# Thesis

We introduce two proximal operator-based algorithms, namely Chambolle-Pock and Primal-Dual Douglas-Rachfold for non convex optimization problems with the objective functions f(x) + g(Dx), where f is convex and g is non convex function. We implement our methods to signal reconstruction problem with l0 norm regularization. Numerical results show that both algorithms similarly converge to critical points and provide good results.
